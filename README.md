# 🧠 Hi, Welcome to my Vault!

[![Obsidian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Obsidian-%23483699.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=obsidian&logoColor=white)](https://obsidian.md/) [![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/shreya-sk/Knowledge-hub?style=for-the-badge&label=Last%20Updated)](https://github.com/shreya-sk/Knowledge-hub/commits/main)

This is a personal knowledge base - maintained in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - containing my learning notes, cheatsheets, and reference materials as I tackle life. This will continuously grow and evolve as I come across new and seemingly interesting topics (From work to fun).

## 🧩 About The Human Behind These Notes

I am someone who believes "I might need this someday" is a valid organization system. My learning style can be seen jumping from DevOps pipelines to midnight LLM tutorials while somehow ending up taking notes on proper Pilates form and wholesome nutrition diet.

Professionally, I'm a *DevOps engineer* in training with roots in _AI/ML applications_ (specifically NLP), but my curiosity refuses to stay in its lane. This vault is where my organized chaos lives – a surprisingly structured collection of random knowledge breadcrumbs I've gathered along my learning journey.

The connections might not always make sense to others, but there's a method to the madness. ..Probably.
## 📚 Topics

Expect to find anything and everything here - a real organised mess of concepts :)

**Topics currently included:**

|Topic|Description|

## 🔍 Navigation

This vault is designed to be browsed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but you can still navigate and read all content directly on GitHub:

- Each folder represents a major topic area
- `_resources` contains shared assets like images and templates
- `MOC` files (Maps of Content) serve as indexes for each topic
## Templates

This vault contains reusable templates for various purposes:

- **Finance**
  - [Expense Tracker](Templates/Finance/Expense-Tracker.md) - Simple, low-effort transaction tracker with automatic calculations
- **Notes**

## 📝 Note Taking Approach

My notes follow these principles:

- **Atomic Notes**: Each note focuses on a single concept
- **Linked Thinking**: Notes are connected through bidirectional links
- **Helpful Analogies**: To break down complex ideas and realate with easier understanding
- **Practical Examples**: Code samples and real-world use cases
- **Progressive Summarization**: Important points are highlighted and summarized
