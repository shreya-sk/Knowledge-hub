## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap: From Beginner to Cloud Native Expert

### 🐳 Phase 1: Docker Fundamentals
- **[[Docker]] Basics** (2-3 weeks)
  - Installing Docker
  - Understanding images and containers
  - Basic Docker commands
  - Writing simple Dockerfiles
  - Building and running containers
- **Docker Intermediate** (2-3 weeks)
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Container networking
  - Volumes and persistent data
  - Docker Compose for multi-container applications
  - Docker best practices and security

### ☸️ Phase 2: Kubernetes Essentials
- **[[Kubernetes]] Basics** (3-4 weeks)
  - Kubernetes architecture
  - Setting up a local environment (Minikube/Kind)
  - Core objects: Pods, Services, Deployments
  - kubectl command-line tool
  - Writing basic YAML manifests
- **Kubernetes Intermediate** (3-4 weeks)
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets
  - Storage and PersistentVolumes
  - Ingress controllers
  - StatefulSets for stateful applications
  - Namespaces and resource quotas

### 🚀 Phase 3: DevOps and Cloud Native Practices
- **CI/CD Pipelines** (2-3 weeks)
  - Automating container builds
  - Continuous integration
  - Continuous deployment to Kubernetes
  - GitOps workflows
- **Monitoring and Observability** (2-3 weeks)
  - Metrics collection with Prometheus
  - Visualization with Grafana
  - Logging with ELK/EFK stack
  - Distributed tracing
- **Security and Best Practices** (2-3 weeks)
  - Container security
  - Kubernetes security
  - Secrets management
  - Policy enforcement

### 🌐 Phase 4: Advanced Topics
- **Service Mesh** (2-3 weeks)
  - Understanding service mesh concepts
  - Implementing Istio
  - Traffic management and canary deployments
- **Serverless on Kubernetes** (2 weeks)
  - Knative or OpenFaaS
  - Event-driven architectures
- **Cloud Provider Integration** (3-4 weeks)
  - AWS EKS or GCP GKE or Azure AKS
  - Cloud-specific services and integrations
  - Multi-cloud strategies

### 📝 Projects to Build Along the Way
1. **Docker Phase**: Containerize a simple web application
2. **Docker Compose Phase**: Multi-container app with frontend, backend, and database
3. **Kubernetes Basics**: Deploy the same app to Kubernetes
4. **Kubernetes Intermediate**: Add persistent storage, secrets, and ingress
5. **DevOps Phase**: Build a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
6. **Advanced Phase**: Implement a service mesh with canary deployments

> [!TIP]
> **Why this order?** Docker is a prerequisite for Kubernetes. We need to understand how containers work before you can orchestrate them. Once you're comfortable with both, we can advance to DevOps practices and more specialized cloud native topics.
